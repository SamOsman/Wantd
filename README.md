# Wantd
The Wantd app was created for the 'Stupid hackathon' event held at Ryerson University.  

The app does the following: 
- Ask the user for permission to read contacts. 
- Go to RCMP wanted page URL and search for names of the wanted criminals from the webpage's source code. 
- Compare the two ArrayLists of names and let you know if you have any positive matches on your phone.
